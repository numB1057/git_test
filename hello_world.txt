Hello Odin world!

What I learned here:
    - modified files are saved localy (CTRL-S)
    - once saved, CTRL-` opens up a terminal in VSC
    - type in 'git add <file name>' to add specific file or 'git add .' to stage files
    - to commit files with a message: 'git commit -m "Edit README.md and hello_world.txt"
